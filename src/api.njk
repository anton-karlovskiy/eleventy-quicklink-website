title: Quicklink
layout: layouts/base.njk
description: Faster subsequent page-loads by prefetching in-viewport links during idle time.
sectionTitle: "## API"
sectionDescription:
  summary: "`quicklink` accepts an optional options object with the following parameters:"
  items:
    - "* `el`: DOM element to observe for in-viewport links to prefetch"
    - "* `urls`: Static array of URLs to prefetch (instead of observing `document` or a DOM element links in the viewport)"
    - "* `timeout`: Integer for the `requestIdleCallback` timeout. A time in milliseconds by which the browser must execute prefetching. Defaults to 2 seconds."
    - "* `timeoutFn`: Function for specifying a timeout. Defaults to `requestIdleCallback`. Can also be swapped out for a custom function like [networkIdleCallback](https://github.com/pastelsky/network-idle-callback) (see demos)"
    - "* `priority`: Boolean specifying preferred priority for fetches. Defaults to `false`. `true` will attempt to use the `fetch()` API where supported (rather than rel=prefetch)"
    - "* `origins`: Static array of URL hostname strings that are allowed to be prefetched. Defaults to the same domain origin, which prevents _any_ cross-origin requests."
    - "* `ignores`: A RegExp, Function, or Array that further determines if a URL should be prefetched. These execute _after_ origin matching."
